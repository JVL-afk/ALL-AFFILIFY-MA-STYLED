# MongoDB Connection Fix

## Issue Fixed

The application was experiencing MongoDB connection errors with the error message:
```
Error creating user: MongoServerSelectionError: connect ETIMEDOUT 65.63.236.210:27017
```

## Changes Made

1. **Enhanced MongoDB Connection Configuration**:
   - Added increased timeout settings
   - Added better error handling
   - Added connection pooling configuration
   - Added retry capabilities for reads and writes

2. **Added Database Health Check Endpoint**:
   - Created a new API route at `/api/health/database` to check database connectivity
   - This can be used to diagnose connection issues

3. **Improved Error Handling in Signup Route**:
   - Added explicit database connection check before processing signup
   - Enhanced error reporting for better debugging

4. **Updated Environment Variables**:
   - Modified `.env.local` to use MongoDB Atlas connection string format
   - Added comments for both local and production configurations

## Deployment Instructions

1. **Update Environment Variables on Vercel**:
   - Go to your Vercel project dashboard
   - Navigate to Settings > Environment Variables
   - Update the `MONGODB_URI` variable with your MongoDB Atlas connection string:
   ```
   MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@<cluster>.mongodb.net/affilify?retryWrites=true&w=majority
   ```

2. **Ensure Network Access in MongoDB Atlas**:
   - Log in to MongoDB Atlas
   - Go to Network Access under Security
   - Add the IP address 0.0.0.0/0 (Allow access from anywhere) or add specific Vercel deployment IP addresses

3. **Verify Database User Permissions**:
   - Ensure your MongoDB user has readWrite permissions on the affilify database

4. **Test the Connection**:
   - After deployment, visit `/api/health/database` to verify database connectivity
   - Try creating a test user to ensure the signup process works

## Troubleshooting

If you continue to experience connection issues:

1. Check the Vercel function logs for detailed error messages
2. Verify that your MongoDB Atlas cluster is running and accessible
3. Confirm that your MongoDB Atlas connection string is correct
4. Try increasing the timeout values in `mongodb.ts` if needed

## Additional Notes

- The MongoDB connection string in `.env.local` should be updated with your actual MongoDB Atlas credentials
- For local development, you can switch back to using a local MongoDB instance if preferred
- The connection pooling settings can be adjusted based on your application's needs
